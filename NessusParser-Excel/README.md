### Inspiration

Inspiration of this came from [Nessus Parser - Cody](http://www.melcara.com/archives/253). While this ruby one is still kicking, I prefer python. I hope to eventually emulate all of the features provide by this tool + more

### Pro's vs Con's
#### Pro's
  - Fast
  - Multi file support
  - Nicely formatted
  - Commented Code (In Progress)

#### Con's
  - Error Checking? What's that! (I have yet to finish this code and wrote it quickly. Didn't implement much of any of this)
 

### Usage

```
pip install pipenv
pip install lxml
pip install xlsxwriter

pipenv install
pipenv shell

General Usage
python nessusparser.py -l FOLDER_WITH_FILES -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/FILENAME
