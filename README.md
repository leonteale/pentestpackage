Contents:

* <b>segmentation.sh</b>          - This is a tool for helping automate the process of segmentation testing for PCI compliance
```Usage: segmentation.sh [OPTION] [filename]
Options:
-I, --ingress | Run ingress testing TO the CDE. Ensure you are connecting to a NON-CDE before running.
-E, --egress  | Run egress testing FROM the CDE. Ensure you are connected to the CDE before running.
-P, --icmp    | ICMP scan on a list of IP addresses [filename]
-F, --fast    | Quick scan using masscan on a list of IP addresses [filename] (all tcp ports)
-h, --help    | This help and exit

Example usage:
./segmentation.sh --icmp    iplist.txt
./segmentation.sh --ingress [networkname] iplist.txt
./segmentation.sh --egress  [networkname] iplist.txt
./segmentation.sh --fast    iplist.txt
```

* <b>suggester.py</b>             - This tool automates the identification of network services from scan results and offers tailored command recommendations or potential attack vectors for each detected service. It aims to expedite the assessment of potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in network services for penetration testers and security analysts.
```Usage:
Options:
-a, --attack  | Enable attack mode to run predefined attacks on detected services.

Available Attack Modules:
- screenshotter (using the -a or --attack option activates this)

Example usage:
